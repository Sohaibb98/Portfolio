# Portfolio

Hi
This is my portfolio of all the major projects i have done, indivudally or in group, Linux based or Windows based, mostly in Back-end high level languages like Python, Java, C++

As a fresh graduate, athis collection has mostly just academia based projects like CLI based or games, hopefully i add much to it in the coming years.

My top skill is Problem-solving with optimized algorithms by keeping a balance in space and time complexity of any code while following design principles to the max.

To keep further enhacning these skills of mine, i actively expplore and solve problems at 2 of the problem solving sites, HackerRank & CodeSignals. Below are the links to my respective profiles:
